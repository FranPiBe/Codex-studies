# Codex Studies

Welcome to **Codex Studies**, a multi-language playground demonstrating how
OpenAI Codex can assist with programming tasks across a variety of domains.
This repository contains small, well-documented examples that are easy to read
and extend.

## What's Inside?

- **Python scripts** – simple utilities illustrating scripting patterns.
- **Jupyter notebooks** – interactive data exploration and ML demos.
- **Web projects** – minimal web applications such as a Flask todo app.
- **CLI tools** – command line interfaces using libraries like `click`.
- **Data analysis** – visualizations and dataset manipulation examples.
- **Machine learning** – quick demos of common algorithms.
- **DevOps** – Docker samples and other infrastructure helpers.
- **Fun experiments** – creative coding showcases.

Supported technologies include Python, Flask, Click, pandas, scikit-learn,
and Docker. More languages and frameworks may be added over time.

## Exploring the Repo

Each top-level folder contains a short `README.md` or notebook explaining its
purpose. Browse through the folders and run the examples that interest you.
Most scripts require only Python 3.8+ and minimal dependencies.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests with
improvements, additional demos, or documentation updates.

## Suggested Badges

Consider adding badges for GitHub stars, Python version, and license once this
project evolves. Other badges such as CI status or Binder links for notebooks
could also be useful.

# Notebooks

Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrate data analysis and exploration tasks.
`pandas_basics.ipynb` introduces basic DataFrame manipulation so new users can
quickly get started with `pandas`.

`python_scripts_usage.ipynb` provides a quick tour of the helper modules in the
`python_scripts` folder and shows example code for each one.

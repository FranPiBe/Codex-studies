# Notebooks

A collection of small Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with Python concepts. Each notebook runs independently and can be modified to explore further.

| Notebook | Summary | Est. time | Libraries |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `pandas_basics.ipynb` | Basic DataFrame creation and display. | 5 min | pandas |
| `python_scripts_usage.ipynb` | Quick tour of helper modules in `python_scripts`. | 5 min | none |
| `regex_exploration.ipynb` | Learn search, match, and groups in `re` with examples for emails, dates and URLs. | 8 min | re |
| `datetime_cheatsheet.ipynb` | Parse strings, use `timedelta`, and work with timezones. | 7 min | datetime |
| `pandas_filtering_and_grouping.ipynb` | Filter rows, avoid chained indexing, and aggregate with `groupby`. | 10 min | pandas |
| `error_handling_patterns.ipynb` | Demonstrates `try/except`, custom exceptions, and logging. | 7 min | logging |
| `functions_vs_classes.ipynb` | Compare a functional vs. class-based calculator. | 5 min | none |
| `plotting_with_matplotlib_and_seaborn.ipynb` | Line and bar plots with style tweaks and annotations. | 8 min | matplotlib, seaborn |

The notebooks encourage experimentation&mdash;feel free to run a cell, modify the code, and see how Codex can help extend the examples.

# Python Scripts

This folder contains small standalone Python scripts. `hello_codex.py` demonstrates
how to parse command line arguments with `argparse` and write the output to a file.
It showcases Codex's ability to document code clearly and implement basic scripting
patterns.

Run it with:

```bash
python hello_codex.py YourName -o greeting.txt
```
